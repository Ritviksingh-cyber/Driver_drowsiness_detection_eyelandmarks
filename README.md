# Driver_drowsiness_detection_eyelandmarks

The project employs data acquired from various sources to train its code effectively. Once the training is completed, the system can accurately detect instances of driver drowsiness. It does this by issuing a series of beeps to warn the driver in real-time. Furthermore, the system keeps track of the frequency of yawns, providing an additional alert mechanism to ensure the driver remains alert and attentive throughout the journey.
